- refactor to just basically use pytorch
- WRITE README

Before Training the model, we would like to take some baby steps:

1. Visualize the patches (all patches extracted in RGB, and the damaged patches)
2. Setup this project on a GPU machine with remote login (either the GPU machine in the student lab or Dept GPU cluster)
