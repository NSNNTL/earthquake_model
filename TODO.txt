- refactor to just basically use pytorch
- WRITE README

Update by Yan Lu 11.11.24:
Baby steps before retrain the model:
1. visulize the extracted patches including damaged/undamaged.
2. setup access and project on a remontely accessible GPU machine (either the one in lab/the department GPU cluster)

After all setup
3. generate synthetic patches to improve the classification results

Goal:
CCI symposium conference. Jan 17th deadline
Student reserach showcase 2025
IGARSS 2025
